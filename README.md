## Joint modeling of wind speed and wind direction through a condition approach
Folders
_______
* Rcode

The **WeiHarReg.R** contains the function `WeiHarReg` used to estimate the directional wind speed distribution.

The **Example.R** provides an example for using `WeiHarReg` function to estimate the directional wind speed distribution.

* Data

An example data set to wich `WeiHarReg` can be applied. The folder contains the **WindData.RData**, which contains wind speed and wind direction observations measured every 10-min during the month of January over the course of 18 years at the Cabauw experimental site for atmospheric research (Cesar) site. 

* Supplementary material

Contains the supplemanetary material pertaining to the manuscript.
