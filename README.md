## Joint modeling of wind speed and wind direction through a condition approach
Folders
_______
* Rcode

The **BWHR.R** contains the function `BWHR` used to estimate the directional wind speed distribution using the proposed binned Weibull harmonic regression method.

The **BPQR.R** contains the function `BPQR` used to estimate the directional wind speed distribution using the periodic B-splines quantile regression method.

The **Example.R** provides an example for using `BWHR` and `BPQR` functions to estimate the directional wind speed distribution.

* Data

An example data set to wich `BWHR` and `BPQR` can be applied. The folder contains the **WindData.RData**, which contains wind speed and wind direction observations measured every 10-min during the month of January over the course of 18 years at the Cabauw experimental site for atmospheric research (Cesar) site. 

* Supplementary Material

Contains the supplemanetary material pertaining to the manuscript.
